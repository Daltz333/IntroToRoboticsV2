XRP (Experiential Robotics Platform) Programming Course
=======================================================

This interactive course provides the basic knowledge and skills necessary to program your XRP robot – using either the Python or Blockly programming languages – for every intermediate challenge. Each module builds on the previous by adding new robotics and programming concepts. New programming techniques are introduced to solve concrete robot problems, allowing students to see the relevance and need for each concept introduced.  The course concludes with a project challenge that requires all of the skills taught in the modules leading up to it. 

The modules are outlined in the syllabus along with the associated learning objectives. There are also short quizzes throughout the course to help students be certain they are learning the important concepts.

The course can be run with one robot per student, or with teams of a few students working on each robot. Working in teams allows students to help each other throughout the course, though it’s important to make sure that work is done by all members of the team to ensure that they are all learning the material.
